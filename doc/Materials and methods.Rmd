## Methods and materials used in paper 

<font size = "4"> 

- Characteristics of the auditory system for functional adaptations analysed:
  (i) Dimension of sound-receiving structures
  (ii) Number of auditory sensilla
  (iii) Hearing sensitivity
- Fifteen species selected for morphometric analysis of auditory structures
- Neuroanatomy and hearing sensitivity investigated in subset of five selected species
- Animals collected at locations in Greece, Slovenia and the Czech Republic 
- Specimens for anatomical measurements collected between 1994 and 1996 and stored in ethanol
- Specimens for neuroanatomical and physiological experiments collected in May/June 2011 and June 2012

##  Material used for our analysis

<div class="columns-2">

<font size = "4"> 

- List of individuals studied from the genus Poecilimon and the out-group genus Isophya(Table  S1)

- **JEvolBiol_Sensory evolution Poecilimon_Database**
Includes the data from morphometric measurements on structures of the auditory system in different Poecilimon tettigoniids and the data from physiological measurements of hearing thresholds.
