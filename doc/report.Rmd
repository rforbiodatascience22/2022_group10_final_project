## Background

<div class="columns-2">

<font size = "4">   

- The paper explores the consequences of communication strategies on adaptive sensory features. 

- Morphology, neuroanatomy and hearing sensitivity

- Uni and bi-directional species

- **Hypothesis:** In bi-directional species selection favours high sensitivity, larger hearing structures and increased sensillae counts.

## Material used for our analysis

<font size = "4"> 
<div class="columns-2">
- Characteristics of the auditory system for functional adaptations analysed:
  (i) Dimension of sound-receiving structures
  (ii) Number of auditory sensilla
  (iii) Hearing sensitivity
- Fifteen species selected for morphometric analysis of auditory structures
- Neuroanatomy and hearing sensitivity investigated in subset of five selected species
- Animals collected at locations in Greece, Slovenia and the Czech Republic 
- Specimens for anatomical measurements collected between 1994 and 1996 and stored in ethanol
- Specimens for neuroanatomical and physiological experiments collected in May/June 2011 and June 2012

## Material used for our analysis

<font size = "4"> 

- List of individuals studied from the genus Poecilimon and the out-group genus Isophya(Table  S1)

- *JEvolBiol_Sensory evolution Poecilimon_Database*
Includes the data from morphometric measurements on structures of the auditory system in different Poecilimon tettigoniids and the data from physiological measurements of hearing thresholds.

## Methods

## Morphological results

- Spracle size correlated with communication system

- Tympana scales with body size

- Sensilla number highest for bidirectional species

## Results
- Spiracle size was correlated with the communication system of the respective species and showed clustering into discrete groups
- The tympana scale with body size , whereas the spiracles differ between uni- and bidirectional acoustically communicating species and between sexes.
- In species with unidirectional communication, the spiracles are much smaller than the
tympana, both in the P. propinquus group and especially in the P. ampliatus group.
- The sensilla number is highest in the three
bidirectional communicating Poecilimon species and the bidirectional out-group species I. modestior
- Although the sexes within a
species were similar, auditory sensitivity differed clearly
between species
-  Representatives of those species with large spiracles (P. ornatus, I. modestior) have
the highest sensitivity
- In P. ampliatus, a representative of a
unidirectional communicating species with small acoustic spiracles, hearing thresholds are rather high, mainly
above 50 dB SPL.
-
## Discussion
- the greatest differences exist between bidirectional and unidirectional communicating species regardless of song characters.
-  Can be assumed that overall body size might be the evolutionary target, if tympanal structures come under positive selection
- Tympana are important structures for sound perception in Tettigoniidae, and neither the acoustic communication system nor sex greatly affects their size.
- Limitations and drawbacks of the plots from the paper
-Alternative representation of the plot(morphological comparison plot)

##Challenges faced
-Loading the script-merging multiple datasets from 1 excel sheet
-Recreating morphometric plots by recognizing the general patterns of the plots
-Removed unexplainable data (e.g. rows in meta data with "ex Stumpner & Heller, 1992")
-lack of consistant ID makes reproducibility difficult
